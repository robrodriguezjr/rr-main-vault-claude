# /weekly dashboard

## Description
Generate a weekly dashboard that combines quantitative metrics with qualitative reflection.  
Source metrics manually (entered by Robert during the prompt) and reflections from his answers.  

## Workflow
1. Prompt Robert for the following metrics:
   - Creative Path Academy members (Standard + Plus)
   - Newsletter subscribers (total + growth)
   - YouTube subscribers and views
   - Website/blog post count or traffic (optional)
   - Any other important number for the week (ARR, open rates, etc.)

2. Prompt Robert for reflections:
   - What worked well this week?
   - What was challenging?
   - Any personal or creative highlights?
   - Health & wellbeing check-in?
   - One big thing to focus on next week?

3. Compile the results into a structured dashboard.

4. Save the dashboard as a new file in `Claude-DA/dashboards/weekly-dashboard-{{date}}.md`.
